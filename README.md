# store_receipt
This is a demo code that prints out a user's purchases and total.

I had always visited superstores/marts and I decided to code how the receipt printing is done using beginner friendly code.

I made a scenario which a user goes to the store to purchase fruits having a total amount of 500. When the user selects an item, it is added to his/her cart and if the amount of purchases exceeds the users initial amount, he/she is prompted to return an item until the total is below the initial amount.

The user also has the option of halting purchase at anytime and proceed directly to checkout.
